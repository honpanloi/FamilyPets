# Family Pets

## Project goal(Make up senario):
  Family Pets is an online marketplace and web application for users to purchase family bred pets. Our goal is to disrupt the pet farming bussiness as our research shows concerns of the breeding environment of those large pet farms as well as the concern of over breeding. Our research also shows rising demand of family bred pets. That's why we invented this on-demand pet breeding marketplace - Family Pets.
